# csFSH
A cross platform library for reading and manipulating SC4 FSH texture files.

Most (or all?) existing libraries for FSH files use the `System.Drawing.Common` package to read and manipulate the bitmaps in a FSH file. Newer versions of .NET have rendered this a [Windows only](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/core-libraries/6.0/system-drawing-common-windows-only) package. To achieve cross-platform operability, this library uses [ImageSharp](https://sixlabors.com/products/imagesharp/) instead.
